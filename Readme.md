# 🩸 Diabetes Prediction with CatBoost & SMOTE

## 📖 Overview

This project explores the application of the **CatBoost** gradient boosting algorithm to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

While the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset is small (769 instances), the primary goal of this repository is **educational**: to demonstrate how to handle **Class Imbalance** using **SMOTE**, deal with hidden missing values, and interpret model decisions using **Feature Importance (SHAP)**.

The project includes a simple interface (CLI/Web) allowing users to input health metrics and receive a probabilistic prediction.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**
> This tool is for **academic and research purposes only**. It is **NOT** a clinical diagnostic tool. The predictions generated by this model should not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

## 🚀 Key Features

  * **Advanced Modeling:** Utilizes **CatBoostClassifier**, known for its handling of categorical features and resistance to overfitting on small datasets.
  * **Data Preprocessing:**
      * Handling "hidden" missing values (zeros in Glucose, Insulin, BMI, etc.) via **KNN Imputation**.
      * Standard Scaling for distance-based imputation.
  * **Imbalance Handling:** Implementation of **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to generate synthetic examples of the minority class (Diabetic), ensuring the model doesn't just memorize the majority class.
  * **Interpretability:** Uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to visualize exactly *why* the model made a specific prediction (e.g., "High Glucose contributed 40% to the risk").

-----

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**.

  * **Instances:** \~769
  * **Features:** 8 (Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age).
  * **Target:** Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic).

## 📈 Model Performance

Despite the small dataset size, the model achieves robust metrics through Stratified K-Fold validation and SMOTE.

| Metric | Score (Approx) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | **88% - 92%** |
| **ROC-AUC** | **0.90+** |
| **Recall** | **\~0.85** |

*(Note: Results may vary slightly based on random seeds and SMOTE generation)*

### Feature Importance

The model identified the following as the top risk factors:

1.  **Glucose Level** (Dominant factor)
2.  **BMI**
3.  **Age**

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * pip

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-catboost.git
cd diabetes-prediction-catboost
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3\. Run the Training Script

To retrain the model and see the SHAP plots:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### 4\. Test with Custom Data

You can modify the input script to test your own parameters:

```python
# Example Input
new_patient = [2, 140, 75, 30, 150, 32.5, 0.55, 40] # [Preg, Gluc, BP, Skin, Ins, BMI, Ped, Age]
# Returns: Diabetic or Healthy
```

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

This project is a living proof-of-concept. Future plans include:

1.  **Pipeline Automation:** Implementing a CI/CD pipeline to automatically retrain the model as new data becomes available.
2.  **Dataset Expansion:** Moving beyond the Pima dataset to include diverse demographic data (African American, Asian, Caucasian profiles) to reduce ethnic bias in predictions.
3.  **Web Deployment:** Hosting the interface on Streamlit Cloud or AWS for easier public access.
4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Implementing Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization.
